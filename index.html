        <h1>Gameplay</h1>
        <p>
            <span>Players are dealt 5 cards each; the deck is then cut and the cut card becomes the first card in the discard pile. Play starts randomly.</span>
            <span>The next card played must be of the same suit or the same value as the card on the top of the discard pile. If a 7 of spades was on the top of the discard pile, the player can play a 9 of spades or a 7 of clubs. If the player cannot play a card, he must draw from the deck.</span>
            <span>Cards can be played in runs, i.e. 5 of Spades, 5 of Diamonds, 5 of Hearts.</span>
            <span>When an action card is played, the player next in sequence must complete the action or add to it to pass in onto the next player in sequence. When down to a single card, a player must say "Macao!". The winner of the game is the first player to have no cards;</span>
        </p>
        <h1>Action cards</h1>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>If a 2 is played, the next player in sequence must pick up 2 cards unless they have a 2, in which case they can add this to the original 2 and the next player in sequence must pick up 4 cards and so on.</li>
                <li>If a 3 is played, the next player in sequence must pick up 3 cards unless they have a 3, in which case they can add this to the original 3 and the next player in sequence must pick up 6 cards and so on.</li>
                <li>If a 4 is played, the next player in sequence must miss a go, unless they have a 4, in which case they can add this to the original 4 and the next player in sequence miss 2 goes.</li>
                <li>If a Jack is played, the player placing the Jack can call for a non-action card value, him and the player in sequence must either play the card value called or place another Jack down and call a different value.</li>
                <li>If a King of Spades is played, the previous player in sequence must pick up 5 cards, unless they have a King of Hearts, in which case they can add this to the original King and the next player in sequence must pick up 10 cards.</li>
                <li>If a King of Hearts is played, the next player in sequence must pick up 5 cards, unless they have a King of Spades, in which case they can add this to the original King and the next player in sequence must pick up 10 cards.</li>
                <li>If a King of Hearts is played or King of Spades is played, the player who must pick up cards can use King of Diamonds or King of Clubs to defend himself and not take any cards.</li>
                <li>If an Ace is played, the player playing the Ace can call a suit suit of choice.</li>
            </ul>
            <span>Multiples action cards can be played, i.e. Player 1 plays three 2s and the next player in sequence must pick up 6 cards unless they have another 2. This is the same for 3's, 4's and Kings.</span>
